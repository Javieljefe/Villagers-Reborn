**Dedicated Server (Multiplayer) Tutorial**
 
 
**Step 1** – Delete any existing “**slimpatch-common.toml**” file in your single-player config folder.
**Step 2** – To choose a skin type (modern or fantasy), edit the “**slimpatch-common.toml**” file both in your multiplayer world’s config folder and in your .minecraft instance. (Modern is the default skin type)
**Step 3** – Run the server!
 
**Issues** 
 
– LAN worlds may show the skin GUI when a player joins (Will be fixed)
– Villager relationship data is saved per entity, so all players share the same relationships with individual villagers (Will be fixed)
– Sometimes it synchronizes with the last skin type selected in single-player (Will be fixed)
 
If the .toml file doesn’t work as expected, create a single player world with the desired skin type, then return to multiplayer / Or simply edit the single-player “slimpatch-common.toml” again. It resets sometimes (Will be fixed)
 
The multiplayer update has been harder than expected, and I’ve encountered some issues making it work as I’d like. I’ll keep improving it to make the multiplayer experience feel just like single player.
 
Thank you, and sorry for the inconvenience!
