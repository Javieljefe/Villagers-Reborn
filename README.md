# **Villagers Reborn**

This mod replaces vanilla villagers with human models while keeping their usual jobs, trades, and behavior. 

The mod adds villager names, personalities, and a dialogue system. It works in any existing world and is compatible with most mods that add custom trades or professions.

It also includes new models and sounds for villagers, illagers, witches, and wandering merchants, as well as a skin selection screen where you can choose between modern or medieval styles.

This mod includes skins from Skindex, you can find the talented authors in the **[Skin Credits](https://github.com/Javieljefe/Villagers-Reborn/blob/main/SKIN_CREDITS.md)**.
